This public GitHub repository demonstrates a WordPress security lab integrating Snort IDS, Fail2Ban IPS, ELK Stack, and Splunk on Ubuntu.


A complete cybersecurity project integrating WordPress with Snort IDS, Fail2Ban IPS, Splunk, and the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Filebeat) for real-time log monitoring and attack detection on an Ubuntu server.

## üß† Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world web server hosting a WordPress site and demonstrates how to secure it using open-source tools. It includes intrusion detection using **Snort**, log forwarding using **Filebeat**, and real-time visualization via **Splunk** and **ELK**. It also implements **Fail2Ban** to automatically ban malicious IPs based on alert patterns.

## üéØ Objectives

- Deploy and configure a secure WordPress environment on Ubuntu.
- Detect intrusion attempts such as SSH brute-force, SQL Injection, and XSS.
- Forward and visualize logs using ELK and Splunk.
- Ban offending IPs automatically using Fail2Ban.
- Simulate attacks to test detection and response systems.
